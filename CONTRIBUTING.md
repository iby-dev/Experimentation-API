# Guidelines

I don't want to get to carried away setting guidelines but essentially I am new to this and I am very much a student of the tech' 
and tools employed in this project so please assume and proceed carefully. 

1. If you want to be part of the project then please clone and create a new branch.
2. Send in a PR and we will review it.
3. I am very much a student of the technologies found in this project so please don't see it as the gospel.
3.1 MongoDB and .NetCore are huge technologies with the latter being a new and distruptive technology. So i am sure there are lots of 
gaps in my knowledge.
4. If you can improve what we have done, then please join our project. 
4.1 The more the merrier.
5. All commits should have a meaningful message posted with them - the more detail the better.

## Issues

If you find an issue and do not want to fix it yourself then:, 

* then create an issue and we will take a look at it. 
* Make sure it is a new issue and has not been reported already by someone else.
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Cosmetic Changes.

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the API will generally not be accepted. Not unless 
if you can convince one us otherwise.

## Feature Requests

If you have an idea then please get in touch or join us <3. That's why I open sourced this badboy so we can all learn from more experience
developers.

The Experimentation API is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
